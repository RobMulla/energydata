# PJM Metered Load Data

From the PJM Website: http://www.pjm.com/markets-and-operations/ops-analysis/historical-load-data.aspx

"The metered load data report summarizes the MW-hour net energy for load as consumed by the service territories within the PJM RTO. Data is supplied by the respective PJM electric distribution companies (EDC) of PJM, and represents the best quality level of metered load within their zones. The report contains company submitted values, with PJM generated estimated values substituted where company data is unavailable. For differentiation, company provided values will have a white background in the cell, and estimated values will have a pink background in the cell. Updates will be posted weekly."
